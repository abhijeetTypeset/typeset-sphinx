Overview
===============

The core of the Typeset Sphinx is the WASP model. The WASP model can be used to represent single-page  as well as, multi-page application. This is one of biggest advantages of using WASP model over traditional testing model such POM. The WASP model has five levels of abstraction, they are:

**Controls**: a control is a user-interface through which a user can provide a meaningful input to the product. For example a button or a textbox are controls.
  
**Widgets**: widgets are interfaces that represent a group of controls. For example a drop-down menu that is a collection of buttons can be described as a widget. It is worthwhile to know that controls within a widget can only be accessed after the widget has been activated.    
  
**Apps**: apps are collection of widgets and controls that can have state independent of other apps in the product. Usually, apps would represent a distinct feature of product. For example, in Typeset, writer is an example of an app.  
  
**Screen**: A screen is a collection of interfaces (including controls, widgets and apps), that may be available to the user at the same time. 
   
**Page**: A page represent a distinct resource in the world-wide web and is generally associated with a unique resource locator (URL). A page may contain different screens depending on the product state.  

Following provides a example of how the WASP model can be used to represent Typeset. More details on using the WASP specification can be found in the subsequent pages.

As shown in the figure above, the framework has three key parts -
1. Model Generator
2. Specification Interface
3. Test Generator  
  
Model generator takes in a Yaml configuration file that follows the language as described in Model-Specificaton and generates the WASP model of the product in Java. The model thus generated, describes the set of features that are supported by the product. The configuration file for the model generator is provided by the developer.

The specification interface is for gathering test specification from the product owner. The specification interface uses the product model provided by the model generator to determine set feasible interactions at a given state in the system. The test specification generated by the specification interface are similar to BDD. The test specification are also provided in Yaml file.

Finally, the test generator takes in the (product) model and and test specifications and converts them into complete test project, that uses `Selenium Webdriver <http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/01_introducing_selenium.jsp>`_. The end result is executable test cases. It is worthwhile to know the test specifications provided to the framework may be partial, i.e. not starting from the root node. In such a scenario, the framework automatically computes the missing part of the test specification.
